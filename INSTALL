WIDE CHARACTER INSTALL

libviper can be compiled with wide character support.  However, there
are several drawbacks to this.  First, the use of wide characters
significantly slows down drawing operations because the wide character
routines in curses are not as fast as their single-byte cousins.  The
reduced performance is usually not noticble on a local machine, but
when running over a low-bandwidth ssh session, it might become
obvious.  Secondly, if you compile libviper with wide character
support you will have to compile future applications for wide
character support and link them against libviper_wide.so.  This means
that you will have to #include <viper_wide.h> rather than <viper.h> in
your application.  For more information on this, take a look at the
VWM source code and Makefile.

To install libviper with wide character support, simply run the following
make commands as root:

make wide
make install_wide

Enjoy!
